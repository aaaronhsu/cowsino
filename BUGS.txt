Bugs that I have found thus far: [we shall talk about then tmrw in class...]
1. on the first thing the client sends to the server, it just sends back the string, not "invalid commnad"
2. no idea where it's sending stuff back to the server
3. help/balance function returns random strings after the first run

ALSO NOTE:
- next thing for me (eliza) to do is to set up the sending of the wheel info 
functionality to the client

TO DO (aaron probably bc I need to debug the code which requires running):
- implement the help and balance functions
