Bugs that I have found thus far: [we shall talk about then tmrw in class...]
1. help/balance function returns random strings after the first run

RIGHT NOW:
1. debug the basic stuff (login, create, 2 easy games)
2. figure out how the wheel game will work
3. make the printing in the terminal nicer
4. alter the exit function so it updates stuff at the end
5. see bugs 1 (now it works every other time... figure out why)
