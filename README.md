Aaron Hsu & Eliza Knapp (Period 5)


## Description of Project
Cowsino is a casino where cows can log into a server to gamble *currency*

## UI
On client connect, the user will be prompted to either log in or create an account. After a user sucessfully logs in (by entering a valid username and corresponding password), they will be able to spend their *currency* to play an assortment of text-based chance games that can earn them *currency*. When the user disconnects, the amount of *currency* they own is updated in the server.

## Technical Design
- Allocating memory (to create structs that store user data)
- Working with files (user data will be stored in files)
- Finding information about files (user data wil be fetched from files on user connect)
  
- Processes 
- Pipes
- Sockets
